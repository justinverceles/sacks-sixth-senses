                <h2>Proprioception: the sense of where the different parts of your body and what they’re doing</h2>
                <p>
                    The nerves running throughout your body create a feedback loop of signals between your body and your brain, letting your brain know where the parts of your body are and what they’re doing, and letting the body know what movements to make. Motor nerves are those nerves through which signals are sent from the brain to the body, whereas sensory nerves are those nerves through which signals are sent from the body to the brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the common experience of an arm or other limb going numb or “falling asleep,” a problem with your motor nerves is what manifests as the inability to move the limb whereas a problem with your sensory nerves is what manifests as the inability to feel the limb. Sensory receptors are located in the muscle spindles within skeletal muscles, as well as in tendons and joints.

                    In <cite>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</cite>, the chapter “The Disembodied Lady” describes the case of a woman who completely lost this sense of proprioception and so could only know where her body was and what it was doing if she constantly checked with her eyes. The ability to move her body was regained but because of that sensory deficit, her actions would always seem unnatural to onlookers. Similar to this case is the case of Ian Waterman as depicted in the BBC documentary, <cite>The Man Who Lost His Body</cite>, shown below.

                <h2>Equilibrioception: the sense of balance</h2>
                <p>
                    Equilibrioception is really a combination of the aforementioned proprioception, the vestibular system, and the sense of sight. The vestibular system is mainly located in the inner ear as the vestibular labyrinth, pictured below by itself and in the context of the rest of the ear. The vestibular labyrinth is composed of the semicircular canals which detect the rotation of the head, and the otolith organs which detect back and forth movement, tilting movement, and gravity.

                <p>
                    In <cite>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</cite>, the chapter “On the Level” describes the case of a man whose equilibrioception was impaired by his Parkinsonism. Thus, when he walked, others would remark to him that he would tilt to one side but he could never tell until he saw a video of himself walking. Sacks writes in this chapter,
                    <blockquote>
                        Parts of the inner ear are indeed physically—literally—like levels; the labyrinth consists of semicircular canals containing liquid whose motion is continually monitored.
                    </blockquote>
                    This liquid is known as endolymph, and the movement of the head causes this liquid to flow into one of three of these orthogonal canals into the ampulla, which contains sensory receptors in the form of hair cells.

            <section id="Thermoreception">
                <h2>Thermoreception: the sense of temperature</h2>
                <p>
                    Temperature is detected by thermoreceptors. Thermoreceptors contain proteins, different kinds of which respond to either warmth or cold and are located on the surface of the skin as well as sensory neurons and peripheral nerves (sensory nerves and motor nerves as mentioned in the section on proprioception). Thermoreceptors usually only respond to temperature (hot and cold), but some are also chemoreceptive, meaning they respond to chemicals such as capsaicin which is found in hot peppers. Others are also mechanoreceptive with respect to pressure, which is why cold objects sometimes seem heavier (a phenomenon known as the silver Thaler illusion).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thermoreceptors are also stimulus-specific, meaning different receptors are excited by different stimuli. When it comes to pain, this means that the experience of pain depends on the specific stimuli whose impulses excite certain nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord which are only excited if those stimuli are harmful, as opposed to the experience of pain depending on the amount of those impulses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CIPA (Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis) is a rare condition wherein the individual is unable to feel pain or temperature, as is the case with Ashlyn Blocker as depicted in the ABC news segment below.

            <section id="Time perception">
                <h2>Time perception: the sense of the passing of time</h2>
                <p>
                    Like the other senses, the perception of time begins early on. In babies, this manifests in their agitation when things take longer than expected or things don’t come when they expect it to. Around the age of five, children begin to understand time as a single continuum by relating how long different tasks take with respect to one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike the other senses, the perception of time is one which doesn’t have any one origin. Rather, it’s a combination of different regions of the brain and different cells performing different operations and monitoring one another. Because of this, there have been no disorders discovered which specifically target this sense. Our perception of time manifests as a sense of how long something takes or how long until something happens, known respectively as explicit timing and implicit timing. Explicit timing is controlled variably by the supplementary motor area (which controls complex movement) of the cerebral cortex and the right prefrontal cortex. Implicit timing is controlled variably by the cerebellum, the left parietal cortex (controlling intended movement) and the left premotor cortex (controlling planned movement).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our perception of time is, thus, not objective, but distorts depending on many different factors including emotions like fear which makes time pass more slowly and excitement which makes time pass more quickly. The sense of time is also dependent on your age, as younger people find time to be slower than older people who find it to pass more quickly. Predominantly, our perception of time is controlled by memory and attention. Children learn to gauge duration by paying attention to a task, which is why children with ADHD tend to find it more difficult to gauge time.
